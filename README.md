## Project Summary

This project aims to collect and analyse data from multiple websites including Melbourne public transport and VicRoads to build a user-friendly website. After the Google BigQuery process, it will show users six features: accidents types, average vehicles count in a month in a road, average car flows in freeways in a month, dangerous areas in Victoria, high-frequency accidents hours in a day and age groups causing most accidents. One additional feature is to select different types like roads, freeways or streets. There is also an accident recording system for both server and client to insert records easily by using Google APIs. One of the most important advantages of my application is the outputs of all data are being visualised instead of showing database search results which can only be viewed by professional people. The webpage/client API is also easy to use for clients.
