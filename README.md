## Project Summary

With the fast development of cities, more individuals decide to buy cars and use them for daily lives, the personal safety of each person is vital, which means traffic analysis system is necessary for informing high-frequency accidents areas, avoiding traffic jam and spend less time on the road to reduce pollution. As the expansion of cities, the government also need to manage traffic conditions and reduce accidents, therefore monitoring them and make efforts accordingly is essential.

This project aims to collect and analyse data from multiple websites including Melbourne public transport and VicRoads to build a user-friendly website. After the Google BigQuery process, it will show users six features: accidents types, average vehicles count in a month in a road, average car flows in freeways in a month, dangerous areas in Victoria, high-frequency accidents hours in a day and age groups causing most accidents. One additional feature is to select different types like roads, freeways or streets. There is also an accident recording system for both server and client to insert records easily by using Google APIs. One of the most important advantages of my application is the outputs of all data are being visualised instead of showing database search results which can only be viewed by professional people. The webpage/client API is also easy to use for clients. Further development can be appiled for the traffic industry.
